    "\n",
    "The Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has been regulating tobacco products since 2009 under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (\"TCA\"). Pub. L. No. 111-31, 123 Stat. 1776 (2009) (codified at 21 U.S.C. ยง 387, et seq.). And since 2016, the FDA has been in the business of regulating e-cigarettes,[1] including those containing no tobacco flavoring. See 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974, 28,976 (May 10, 2016). In order to continue marketing e-cigarettes, manufacturers must submit to the FDA a premarket tobacco product application (\"PMTA\"). 21 U.S.C. ยง 387j.\n",
    "\n",
    "In June 2019, the FDA issued a \"how-to\" guide for submitting e-cigarette PMTAs. FDA, Guidance for Industry, Premarket Tobacco Applications for Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (June 2019) (\"PMTA Guidance\"), https://bit.ly/2R5TyYj. In it, the agency stated that it \"does not expect that applicants will need to conduct long-term studies to support an application.\" Id. at 13. The Proposed and Final Rules repeated this expectation. See Premarket Tobacco Product Applications and Recordkeeping Requirements, 86 Fed. Reg. 55,300, 55,387 (October 4, 2021); 84 Fed. Reg. 50,566, 50,619 (Sept. 25, 2019). The FDA also recommended that applicants 188*188 use \"products that consumers are most likely to consider[] interchangeable\" when submitting \"comparative health risk data.\" PMTA Guidance at 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this guidance in mind, Petitioner R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company (\"RJRV\") submitted a PMTA for its menthol-flavored Vuse Vibe e-cigarette on March 31, 2020,[2] well ahead of the September 9, 2020, deadline. See 21 U.S.C. ยง 387j; Wages, 16 F.4th at 1135. On December 18, 2020, the FDA sent RJRV a deficiency letter regarding several other pending PMTAs for RJRV's flavored ENDS. The FDA instructed RJRV to \"provide evidence to demonstrate that the use of these flavored products (other than menthol) increases the likelihood of complete switching among adult smokers relative to tobacco or menthol-flavored products.\" (emphasis added). Because this advice expressly excluded its menthol-flavored products, RJRV did not supplement its menthol Vuse Vibe PMTA.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Over two years later, on January 24, 2023, the FDA denied RJRV's PMTA in a marketing denial order (\"Denial Order\"). A stated basis for the denial was that RJRV's long-term studies \"were not brand-or product-specific,\" and, as such, \"did not demonstrate that [RJRV's] menthol-flavored new products are more likely to promote complete switching or significant cigarette reduction compared to tobacco-flavored products.\" Additionally, the FDA stated that the \"marketing restrictions and other mitigation measures that [RJRV] proposed cannot mitigate ... risks to youth sufficiently.\" RJRV petitioned the FDA for a stay, which was denied. RJRV and three other companies then petitioned this court for review and moved to stay the Denial Order.[4] We granted an administrative stay, and now we enter a full stay pending resolution of RJRV's petition on the merits.\"\"\""
